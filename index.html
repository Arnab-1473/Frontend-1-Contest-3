            <h3 class="me-1">History</h3>
            <p>The history of forts in India through the medieval era is a harmonious continuation of its past. Several
                forts built in the ancient times were fought over, captured, recaptured, destroyed and occupied over the
                centuries. Architectural changes reflected the changing atmosphere of the country. The developments
                during the medieval period are closely related to the military and political history of the subcontinent
                between the 13th and the 18th centuries. This section aims to throw light on the broad features of forts
                during this period. <br>
                        Sultanate architecture involved the use of the arch and dome technique. This was not a Turkish
                invention, but was borrowed from Arabs who borrowed it from Rome. Before becoming privy with this
                technique, Indians used the slab and beam technique which involved putting one stone over another and
                covering it with coping stone till the gap was closed. The art of putting a round dome on a square
                building base, enabled rooms to have a clear view as no support structures obstructed the spaces. They
                used a fine quality, superior lime mortar for construction and the decorations involved geometric
                designs with verses from the Quran. <br>
                The Khilji rule was followed by the rule of the Tughlaqs in Delhi. Tughlaq architecture saw a new trend of building structures on high platforms as can be seen in Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq’s tomb. In the political arena, the state of Mewar regained its freedom during the reign of the Tughlaq dynasty in the 14th century by defeating Muhammad bin Tughlaq in the historical battle of Singoli in 1336. The Rajput states now spread their dominance till the state of Bengal and Raja Man Singh Tomar made additions to the Gwalior fort in present day Madhya Pradesh. Firoz Shah Tughlaq,  built the Firoz Shah Kotla fortified complex in the 14th century. This complex exhibits the technique of ‘batter’ or sloping walls which sloped inwards to render a structure stable and strong under attack.

                            to live. Jaisalmer traces its inception to the 12th century. Jaisalmer Fort is the second oldest fort in Rajasthan, built in 1156 AD by the Rajput Rawal (ruler) Jaisal from whom it derives its name, and stood at the crossroads of important trade routes (including the ancient Silk road).</p>
